% Example based on Aiyagari (1994).
%
% These codes set up and solve the Aiyagari (1994) model for a given
% parametrization. After solving the model they then show how some of the
% vfitoolkit commands to easily calculate things like the Gini coefficient
% for income, and how to plot the distribution of asset holdings.
%
% VFI Toolkit automatically detects hardware (GPU? Number of CPUs?) and
% sets defaults accordingly. It will run without a GPU, but slowly. It is
% indended for use with GPU.

%% Set some basic variables

% VFI Toolkit thinks of there as being:
% k: an endogenous state variable (assets)
% z: an exogenous state variable (exogenous labor supply)

% Size of the grids
n_k=2^9;%2^9;
n_z=11; %21;

% Parameters
Params.beta=0.96; %Model period is one-sixth of a year
Params.alpha=0.36;
Params.delta=0.08;
Params.mu=3;
Params.sigma=0.2;
Params.rho=0.6;

%% Set up the exogenous shock process
% Create markov process for the exogenous labour productivity, l.
Tauchen_q=3; % Footnote 33 of Aiyagari(1993WP, pg 25) implicitly says that he uses q=3
[z_grid,pi_z]=discretizeAR1_Tauchen(0,Params.rho,sqrt((1-Params.rho^2)*Params.sigma^2),n_z,Tauchen_q);
% Note: sigma is standard deviations of s, input needs to be standard deviation of the innovations
% Because s is AR(1), the variance of the innovations is (1-rho^2)*sigma^2

[z_mean,z_variance,z_corr,~]=MarkovChainMoments(z_grid,pi_z);
z_grid=exp(z_grid);
% Get some info on the markov process
[Expectation_l,~,~,~]=MarkovChainMoments(z_grid,pi_z); %Since l is exogenous, this will be it's eqm value 
% Note: Aiyagari (1994) actually then normalizes l by dividing it by Expectation_l (so that the resulting process has expectation equal to 1)
z_grid=z_grid./Expectation_l;
[Expectation_l,~,~,~]=MarkovChainMoments(z_grid,pi_z);
% If you look at Expectation_l you will see it is now equal to 1
Params.Expectation_l=Expectation_l;

%% Grids

% In the absence of idiosyncratic risk, the steady state equilibrium is given by
r_ss=1/Params.beta-1;
K_ss=((r_ss+Params.delta)/Params.alpha)^(1/(Params.alpha-1)); %The steady state capital in the absence of aggregate uncertainty.

% Set grid for asset holdings
k_grid=10*K_ss*(linspace(0,1,n_k).^3)'; % linspace ^3 puts more points near zero, where the curvature of value and policy functions is higher and where model spends more time

% Bring model into the notational conventions used by the toolkit
d_grid=0; %There is no d variable
a_grid=k_grid;
% z_grid
% pi_z;

n_d=0;
n_a=n_k;
% n_z

% Create functions to be evaluated
FnsToEvaluate.K = @(aprime,a,z) a; %We just want the aggregate assets (which is this periods state)

% Now define the functions for the General Equilibrium conditions
    % Should be written as LHS of general eqm eqn minus RHS, so that the closer the value given by the function is to 
    % zero, the closer the general eqm condition is to holding.
GeneralEqmEqns.CapitalMarket = @(r,K,alpha,delta,Expectation_l) r-(alpha*(K^(alpha-1))*(Expectation_l^(1-alpha))-delta); %The requirement that the interest rate corresponds to the agg capital level
% Inputs can be any parameter, price, or aggregate of the FnsToEvaluate
